## Why MongoDB?

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is designed for storing and retrieving large volumes of unstructured data. It uses a document-oriented data model, which means data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents. This flexibility allows MongoDB to handle large volumes of unstructured data efficiently.

One of the key advantages of MongoDB is its dynamic schema capability. This means that the structure of the data can change over time without requiring a complex migration process. This is particularly useful for applications that need to evolve quickly or handle diverse data types.

Additionally, MongoDB is designed for scalability and high performance. It can easily scale out by distributing data across multiple servers, which helps in managing large datasets and high traffic loads. This makes MongoDB a suitable choice for a variety of applications, especially those that require handling large amounts of data with varying structures.
